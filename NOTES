Test parameters:
  Number of items per work group
  Number of work groups
  Normal number of iterations
  Increased number of iterations (one group or all groups)
  Initial value location (compute/local/global)
  Result location (local/global)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Work definition:
  Load/compute the initial CRC value.
  Iterate the specified number of times.
  Store the result (local/global)
